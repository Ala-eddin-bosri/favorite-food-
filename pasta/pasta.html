        Ingredients
           <br>Pasta
            400g
            <br>Zucchini
            800g
            <br>Onion
             2
            <br>Garlic
            1 pod
            
            <br>Olive oilLiquid cream
            2 cases
            
            <br>Pink berries
            
            <br>Salt
            <br>Pepper
            <br>PREPARATION
           
<br>1/Wash the courgettes, grate 3/4 and cut the rest into small cubes. Peel the onions, chop them finely. Peel the garlic clove, chop it.
<br>2/In a saucepan, heat some olive oil. Add the onions, minced garlic and cook for a few minutes, until the onions become translucent. Add the grated zucchini, salt and pepper. Cook for a few minutes, the time to cook the zucchini. Add the pink peppercorns. I add the pink peppercorns at the last moment so that they don't infuse too much, since it's quite a strong taste.
<br>3/Mix the cooked grated zucchini, and add the liquid cream. Adjust the seasoning if necessary with salt, pepper and pink peppercorns.
<br>4/Cook the pasta in plenty of salted boiling water.
<br>5/
In a pan, heat the zucchini cream, and add the drained pasta. Mix and leave for 1 to 2 minutes for the flavors to absorb.
<br>To finish
Serve, and add the diced raw zucchini on top, for a cooked/raw and hot/cold mixture

<p>Ingredients for 2 persons
    <br>200 g pasta
    <br>1 chorizo
    <br>2 tomatoes
   <br> 1 green bell pepper
    <br>40 cl of water
    <br>1 tablespoon olive oil
    <br>salt, pepper</p>
   <br> PREPARATION
<br>1/Wash the vegetables, cut the tomatoes into pieces, seed the bell pepper and cut into strips. Cut the chorizo into fairly thin slices.
<br>2/In a large saucepan, pour in the water and oil and add all the other ingredients.
<br>3 /Bring to a boil over high heat and cook about 10 minutes after boiling, stirring very often so that the pasta does not stick to the bottom of the pan.
<br>Finally
At the end of cooking the pasta should be al dente and the cooking water almost evaporated to leave a creamy sauce.

        <h1>linguine pasta with cherry tomatoes and basil</h1>
        <img src="/pic/linguine pasta.jpg" alt=""width="350" height="250">
        <p>Ingredients for 2 people
            <br>150 to 200g linguine pasta
            <br>a dozen cherry tomatoes
            <br> onion not too big
            <br>1 clove of garlic
            <br>3 sprigs of basil
            <br>1 piece of sweet chili pepper
        <br>2 tablespoons olive oil
            <br>2 or 3 pinches of fleur de sel
            <br>2 pinches of black pepper
            <br>50 cl of water
           <br> PREPARATION
<br>1/Rinse the cherry tomatoes and cut them in half. Peel and chop the onion and the garlic clove. Rinse the basil. Chop the piece of sweet chili pepper (quantity according to your taste).
<br>2/In a fairly large saucepan, place the pasta and all the ingredients. Add the water and cook for 10 to 15 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally, there should be a bottom of the cooking liquid and the pasta should be "al dente".
<br>3/
Leave to rest for 5 minutes and serve immediately with a little grated parmesan.
<br>To finish
My saucepan was not large enough, so I had to break the pasta in two so that they were in contact with the water from the start of cooking.
