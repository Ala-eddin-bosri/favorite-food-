        <img src="/img/Blueberry Muffins.jpg" alt="/"width="350" height="250">
        <p>
            Ingredients for 6 people
<br>For 15 to 20 muffins:
<br>260g flour
<br>160g sugar or brown sugar
<br>2 eggs
<br>200g fresh or frozen blueberries
<br>120ml milk
<br>80ml oil
<br>1/2 teaspoon baking powder
  <br>PREPARATION
<br>1/Preheat your oven to 180Â° (thermostat 5-6).
<br>2/In a large bowl, mix the flour with the icing sugar and the almond powder. Add the egg yolk and the melted butter and mix again. Beat the egg whites then, using a spatula, fold them into the mixture.
<br>3/ Rinse, quickly dry the blueberries and accompany them, barely stirring. Divide the preparation into 4 / small silicone molds and bake for 12 to 15 minutes. Check for doneness with the tip of a knife, which should appear dry.
<br>pour finish
Paysan Breton's tip: If you can't find fresh blueberries, you can use frozen ones. In this case, reproduce them still frozen, in step 5, so that their juice does not color the cupcakes.
